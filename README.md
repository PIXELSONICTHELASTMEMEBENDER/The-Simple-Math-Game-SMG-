# READ THIS BEFORE STARTING THE GAME:

**For the Best Experience:**

Press the "Open" button on the top right of the screen, for a full Experience!
__________________
**Instructions:**

In this game you will go through a series of math questions,
to test your knowledge of math! If you get some wrong that's fine you can restart.
But try to get them on your first try!

**Errors and Invalid statements:**
__________________
If you put a string when it asks you the answer, in number form, for a specific question
it will print out the following statement: "Invalid Response". When it says that, that means you haven't put 
the answer in number form. So to fix that, you will need to restart the game and put the answer in
the right format (number (int) format.)

**Automation of the Questions:**
__________________
The questions will generate right after you answer the previous question, your have to be patient
with the automation. I put a delay of 2 seconds, so it will take 2 seconds to generate the next question.
So don't be frightened if the question doesn't come quickly!

**Questions and Comments:**
__________________
If you have a question about this game, unfortunately I cannot look at the comments since this game isn't public
in the repl community. To make a game public you need to pay for it, which I didn't do! 
But I myself play this a couple of times to see if I made mistakes in my code. So don't worry.
